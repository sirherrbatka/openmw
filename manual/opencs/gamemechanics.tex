\section{Game mechanics}

%TODO this section really needs to be splited into few. This file is placed here for writting this todo.
%the actual manual part should cover GMSTs (description for each) AI related topics and other things that came as morrowind support. Please, consider that in the future we will need to add extensive description of future possibilites, for instance how to add new skills, as well as extend present descriptions to reflect fact that they are somewhat just a subset of what we support.
