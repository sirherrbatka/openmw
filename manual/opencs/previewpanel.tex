\section{Preview Panel}

\subsection{Introduction}
Each time I was using Construction Set I was thinking that it would be nice to have way to preview game world items without actually placing item in the game world. Sadly, this feature was missing -- but be joyfull as in the bright days of the OCS{} you can actually do that! That's what the preview panel is for.

%TODO preview panel as for the 2014 is actually very simple tool for inspecting referencable models in 3D enviorment. It is usefull, but once we will get more user input it may grow in extra features to make it even more usefull. Perhaps automatic switching to the currently selected referencable (sounds like something that scripting bindings would be good for).
